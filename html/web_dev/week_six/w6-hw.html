            Ah, Grief, I should not treat you<br>
            like a homeless dog<br>
            who comes to the back door<br>
            for a crust, for a meatless bone.<br>
            I should trust you.<br><br>
            I should coax you<br>
            into the house and give you<br>
            your own corner,<br>
            a worn mat to lie on,<br>
            your own water dish.

        <section class="grid-item">
            You think I don't know you've been living<br>
            under my porch.<br>
            You long for your real place to be readied<br>
            before winter comes. You need<br>
            your name,<br>
            your collar and tag. You need<br>
            the right to warn off intruders,<br>
            to consider<br>
            my house your own<br>
            and me your person<br>
            and yourself<br>
            my own dog.
