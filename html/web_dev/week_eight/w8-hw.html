        I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown<br>
        I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud<br>
        They don't know that every night<br>
        I unthread all the work I've done<br>
        'Cause I'd rather lie<br>
        Than allow them to think they've won<br>
        Though I never thought that I'd resort to this<br>
        Just know I'll be here<br>
        But I don't know how much longer I'll last since we saw that storm<br>
        And though it was so close to our kingdom, it was far from the norm, unless<br>
        Oh, could it be some kinda sign<br>
        That my world is all about to change?<br>
        Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?<br>
        Though I never thought that it would come to this<br>
        Just know I'll be here buying you time<br>
    </section>

    <section id="section_2" class="lyrics-section">
        Time is fleeting, it's running out<br>
        Time to be the man of the house (oh, buying you time)<br>
        Time is fleeting, it's running out<br>
        Time to be the man of the house<br>
        Whoever can string my husband's old bow<br>
        And shoot through 12 axes cleanly<br>
        Will be the new king, sit down at the throne<br>
        And rule with me as his queen<br>

    <section id="section_3" class="lyrics-section">
        Let the arrow fly<br>
        Once you know that your aim is true<br>
        'Cause I'd rather die<br>
        Than grow old without the best of you<br>
        Though I never thought that these would be the lengths we go for love<br>
        I would not have it any other way<br>
        And though I never thought that it would end like this<br>
        Just know I'll be here<br>
        Waiting, waiting<br>
        waiting, waiting<br>
        (Penelope) waiting, waiting<br>
        Oh<br>
