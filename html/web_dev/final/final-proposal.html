        <p>
            The final project is a 'Fictitious' truth. The 'Truth' I decided to go with was that the earth isn't circular, but it is a cube.
            I enjoy this Fictitious truth since a common conspiracy theory is that the earth is flat and i want to poke fun at that idea.
            I want to make it in the same vain as 'The Book of Mormon' musical and how it pokes fun while still being somewhat respectful
        </p>

        <p>
            The organization that is presenting this info is "The Cube Earth Society" and after looking up "the cube earth society" I found a funny picture
            where the slogan is "Because a Flat Earth is just stupid" and that just cracks me up. This organization would present photos from Minecraft as
            their "proof" that the earth is a cube and not a sphere or flat.
        </p>

        <p>
            This could definitely end up being useful since it is purposely fictitious it could help people look into it and help reinforce the idea of a sphere earth.
            Though a lot of people tend to read stuff and not double-check the statements and that could cause issues though it should be obvious that the cube earth society isn't real.
