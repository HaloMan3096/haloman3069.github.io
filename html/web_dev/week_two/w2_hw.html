      <h4>GeoCites and the death of community</h4>
      <p>The GeoCities era sounds like anyone could create their own websites both a curse and a gift.
        That allowed people to really create and experiment with the techniques they used.
        Allowing for all websites to be unique, where now websites all are built very similarly to each other.
        while I can understand why business people would want their websites all to be similar to each other,
        it feels like some of the culture that those old sites had has died. I agreed when the author suggested that,
        the internet is the best example for the thesis “capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love”.
        While you can still get some of the community elements from sites like YouTube and Reddit,
        those sites tend to point to discords where conversations happen in their own encapsulated bubbles.

      <h4>Social Media internet</h4>
      <p> As the GeoCites and MySpace era's came to their ends, facebook and Twitter arose.
        Though these pages gave the users less control over how their pages looked it allowed for ease of use.
        it was harder for the user to "glitter" or "pimp" out their pages. but it was easier to get started.
        I think it would be cool if more social media sites would let you "pimp" out your profile so,
        people could quickly get to know you without having to go through all of you posts.
