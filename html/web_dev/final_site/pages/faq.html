            <h3>Q: Is the Earth really a cube?</h3>
            <p>A: Absolutely. If the Earth was flat, why don’t our oceans just fall off the edge? And if it were a
                sphere, how do you explain corner weather? The Cube Earth model neatly explains all observed
                phenomena—plus, it has edges you can actually measure (with a spirit level and some courage).</p>

            <h3>Q: Why haven’t scientists proven this?</h3>
            <p>A: Many have. But those brave enough to publish their findings were quickly silenced, pixelated, or
                replaced by AI-generated holograms. Dr. Merle Hexagon and Prof. Iliana Boxworthy are two of our finest
                minds still resisting the smear campaign.</p>

            <h3>Q: What about photos from space?</h3>
            <p>A: Photos from “space” are notoriously unreliable. NASA conveniently crops out the corners in every
                so-called Earth image. Ever seen a full image of all six sides? Exactly. We’ve leaked documents showing
                Cube Shadow suppression going back to the '60s.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why aren’t compasses weird on a cube?</h3>
            <p>A: That’s where quantum magneto-edge refraction (QMER) comes in. The field bends at corners but
                stabilizes on the faces. It’s basic Edgeology—look it up (on our site, obviously).</p>

            <h3>Q: What lies beneath the Cube?</h3>
            <p>A: Olympus. A divine, unknowable plane where the Cube’s gravity source resides. Also rumored to be the
                gods’ vacation home, stocked with ancient vending machines and giant pets.</p>

            <h3>Q: How does the Odyssey prove Cube Earth?</h3>
            <p>A: Homer clearly described Odysseus traveling to different "lands" that defied traditional geography.
                These aren’t metaphorical—they’re Cube Faces. He was banished from the top (Human World) and forced to
                traverse the sides before returning to civilization.</p>

        <section class="info-banner">
            <h3>Q: Can I visit the other sides?</h3>
            <p>A: Not legally. Most governments have “restricted zone” policies, especially around the Bermuda Corner.
                But if you join at a higher membership tier, we can send you coordinates and a detailed tutorial on
                building an edge-climber.</p>
