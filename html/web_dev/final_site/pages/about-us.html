            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>To expose the spherical lie, outshine the flat fallacy, and restore cubic clarity to a world trapped in
                curves.</p>
            <p>We are scientists (unverified), philosophers (self-declared), historians (highly selective), and critical
                thinkers (dangerously so) who have come together with one shared purpose:
                To reveal that the Earth is a cube.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-banner">
            <h3>Our Origin Story</h3>
            <p>C.U.B.E. began in a garage. Like all good truths, it was born during a blackout, with nothing but a
                whiteboard, a Rubik’s Cube, and a half-eaten geometry textbook. Since then, our numbers have grown — not
                in quantity, but in intensity.</p>
            <p>We’ve interviewed Atlantis experts, decoded pre-Socratic cube references, and even attempted a
                cube-shaped globe (we call it the Globoid, and it's available in the gift shop).</p>

        <section class="info-banner">
            <h3>Our Methods</h3>
            <p>We don’t rely on traditional peer review. We rely on peer reverence.
                Our research combines ancient myth, leaked documents, post-shape metaphysics, and “accidentally
                released” NASA schematics to present a model that makes too much sense to be wrong.</p>
            <p>Flat Earth logic collapses at the corners. Spherical Earth logic rolls away. Cube Earth stands tall,
                solid, and still — just as it always has.</p>

            <h3>Why the Cube?</h3>
            <p>The cube is the perfect shape: symmetrical, stable, and ignored by mainstream science for too long.
                Unlike the deceptive round Earth model, which requires complex gravity workarounds and inconvenient
                curvature math, the Cube Earth model offers right angles, flat faces, and undeniable truth.</p>
            <p>Each face hosts unique magnetic patterns, gravitational orientations, and possibly entire lost
                civilizations. We’ve documented corner slip phenomena, dimensional echo zones, and irregular cosmic
                shading — all pointing to an angular truth..</p>

            <h3>The "Spherical Cover-Up"</h3>
            <p>NASA, globemakers, and Big Compass are complicit in a massive, multi-national deception. Why? Because a
                cube Earth changes everything: flight patterns, time zones, energy fields, even the shape of pizza.</p>
            <p>In 1984, a low-resolution image leaked from the Challenger program showed a corner peeking out beyond the
                "horizon." It was quickly scrubbed. We've recreated it in Blender. The truth has edges — sharp ones.</p>

            <h3>Our Security Measures</h3>
            <p>All member identities are encrypted using EdgeCrypt™ — a proprietary algorithm that folds your data into
                a 4D cube. Profile photos are anonymized via cube proxies: minerals, dice, tesseracts, or suspiciously
                symmetrical rocks.</p>
            <p>NASA cannot locate us. Mostly because we live on different faces.</p>
